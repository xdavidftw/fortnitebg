# Fortnite ranking system discord bot

## How it work?

With this script, discord users can rank themself with commands.  
Your rank depend of your overall fortnite Kill/Death ratio.
Here are the ranks you can have, __you need to create all of these ranks in your discord in order the bot to work. If you misspelled a word, errors will occur.__
```
@Wood,        0.00 → 0.99  K/D  
@Carton,      1.00 → 1.49  K/D  
@Bronze,      1.50 → 1.99  K/D  
@Silver,      2.00 → 2.49  K/D  
@Gold,        2.50 → 2.99  K/D  
@Platinum,    3.00 → 3.49  K/D  
@Diamond,     3.50 → 3.99  K/D  
@Ruby,        4.00 → 4.99  K/D  
@Royality,    5.00 → 5.99  K/D  
@Illuminati,  6.00 → 7.99  K/D  
@Hackeur,     8.00 → +  K/D  
```

Once the ranks are created you can create rooms with permissions based on the rank / K/D of the user.
